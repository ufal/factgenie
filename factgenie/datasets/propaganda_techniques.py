    Stating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or expert on the issue said it was true, without any other supporting evidence offered. We consider the special case in which the reference is not an authority or an expert in this technique, altough it is referred to as Testimonial in literature.
    Example 1: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true."
    Explanation: Richard Dawkins certainly knows about evolution, and he can confidently tell us that it is true, but that doesn't make it true. What makes it true is the preponderance of evidence for the theory.
    Example 2: "According to Serena Williams, our foreign policy is the best on Earth. So we are in the right direction." Details: since there is a chance that any authority can be wrong, it is reasonable to defer to an authority to support a claim, but the authority should not be the only justification to accept the claim, otherwise the Appeal-to-Authority fallacy is committed.

    Seeking to build support for an idea by instilling anxiety and/or panic in the population towards an alternative.
    In some cases the support is built based on preconceived judgements.

    Attempting to persuade the target audience to join in and take the course of action because "everyone else is taking the same action".

    Presenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when in fact more possibilities exist. As an the extreme case, tell the audience exactly what actions to take, eliminating any other possible choices (Dictatorship).
    Example 1: "You must be a Republican or Democrat. You are not a Democrat. Therefore, you must be a Republican"
    Example 2: "I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today."
    Explanation: The assumption here is that if one doesn't attend chuch, one must be bad. Of course, good people exist who don’t go to church, and good church-going people could have had a really good reason not to be in church.

    Assuming a single cause or reason when there are actually multiple causes for an issue.
    It includes transferring blame to one person or group of people without investigating the complexities of the issue
    Example 1: "President Trump has been in office for a month and gas prices have been skyrocketing. The rise in gas prices is because of President Trump."
    Example 2: "The reason New Orleans was hit so hard with the hurricane was because of all the immoral people who live there."
    Explanation: This was an actual argument seen in the months that followed hurricane Katrina. Ignoring the validity of the claims being made, the arguer is blaming a natural disaster on a group of people.

    Using words which are deliberately not clear so that the audience may have its own interpretations.

    Example 1: "It is a good idea to listen to victims of theft. Therefore if the victims say to have the thief shot, then you should do that."
    Explanation: the definition for "listen to" is equivocated here. In the first case it means listen to their personal account of the experience of being a victim of theft. Empathize with them. In the second case "listen to" means carry out a punishment of their choice.

    Example 2: "You may claim that the death penalty is an ineffective deterrent against crime -- but what about the victims of crime?

When an opponent's proposition is substituted with a similar one which is then refuted in place of the original proposition.

Example 1: Zebedee: What is your view on the Christian God?
Mike: I don’t believe in any gods, including the Christian one.
Zebedee: So you think that we are here by accident, and all this design in nature is pure chance, and the universe just created itself?
Mike: You got all that from me stating that I just don’t believe in any gods?

Explanation: Mike made one claim: that he does not believe in any gods. From that, we can deduce a few things, like he is not a theist, he is not a practicing Christian, Catholic, Jew, or a member of any other religion that requires the belief in a god, but we cannot deduce that he believes we are all here by accident, nature is chance, and the universe created itself.
