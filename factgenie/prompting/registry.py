# Tutorial on how to use the classes below:
#
# For a simple registry that doesn't warn users when they forget to register their class:
#     register_foo = Registry(FooBaseClass, "register_foo")
# This gains you the ability to use @register_foo as a decorator above any Foo(FooBaseClass).
# To then access the registered subclasses, use:
#     register_foo.registered_subclasses
#
# If you wish users to get notified when they forget to register their class, also add:
#     @track_subclasses above FooBaseClass
#     unregistered_foo_tracker = UnregisteredTracker(FooBaseClass, [register_foo])
# Then to see a warning about newly discovered unregistered subclasses, just call:
#     unregistered_foo_tracker.warn_about_unregistered_subclasses()
#
# To supress warnings about unregistered subclass on mock classes, use the @untracked decorator.
#
# WARNING: The classes won't be found if their file is never importred!


# This creates a registry, e.g. `register_llm_gen = Registry(...)`.
# It works as a decorator because it is callable.
