  In this task, you will annotate translation errors in machine-generated translations. For each example, you will see the **source text** on the left side and the corresponding **translation** on the right side. Your task is to **identify and classify errors** in the translation.

  There are 13 types of errors that you can mark in the translation:

  **Accuracy Errors:**
  - <span style="color: rgb(230, 124, 124); text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 4px; text-decoration-skip-ink: none"><b>Accuracy (Minor)</b></span>: Minor factual errors or inaccuracies in the translation.
  - <span style="color: rgb(214, 38, 38); text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 4px; text-decoration-skip-ink: none"><b>Accuracy (Major)</b></span>: Major factual errors or inaccuracies that significantly affect meaning.

  **Terminology Errors:**
  - <span style="color: rgb(124, 161, 243); text-decoration: underline; text-decoration-thickness: 4px; text-decoration-skip-ink: none"><b>Terminology (Minor)</b></span>: Minor terminology issues or inconsistent term usage.

  You can annotate errors by selecting the appropriate error category and dragging your mouse over the text to highlight the error span. Error spans can include parts of words, whole words, or multi-word phrases.

  Once you think you have marked all the errors present in the translation, click the **âœ… Mark example as complete** button (you can still update the annotation later).

  You will be able to submit the annotations once they are all marked as complete.
