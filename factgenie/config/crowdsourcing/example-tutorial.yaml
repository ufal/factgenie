annotator_instructions: |-
  In this task, you will annotate outputs of an automatic text generation system. For each example, you will see **data** from a basketball game on the left side and the corresponding generated **text** on the right side. Your task is to **annotate errors** in the text with respect to the data.

  There are six types of errors that you can mark in the generated text:

  1. <b><span style="background-color: #d6d0f7">NAME</span></b> (Incorrect named entity): This includes people, places, teams, and days of the week.
  2. <b><span style="background-color: #d8f7d0">NUMBER</span></b> (Incorrect number): It does not matter whether the number is spelled out or is in digits.
  3. <b><span style="background-color: #f0cfc9">WORD</span></b> (Incorrect word): A word which is not one of the above and is incorrect.
  4. <b><span style="background-color: #eacded">NOT_CHECKABLE</span></b> (Not checkable): A statement which can not be checked, either because the information is not available or because it is too time-consuming to check.
  5. <b><span style="background-color: #e3cac9">CONTEXT</span></b> (Context error): A phrase which causes an incorrect inference because of context or discourse.
  6. <b><span style="background-color: #cef3f7">OTHER</span></b> (Other): Any other type of mistake.

  You can annotate the errors by selecting the appropriate error category and dragging your mouse over the text, highlighting the error span.

  Once you think you have marked all the errors present in the text, click the **âœ… Mark example as complete** button (you can still update the annotation later).

  You will be able to submit the annotations once they are all are marked as complete.
