  Output the errors as a JSON list "annotations" in which each object contains fields  "reason", "text", and "type". The value of "text" is the text of the error. The value of "reason" is the reason for the error. The value of "type" is one of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} based on the following list:
  - 0: Incorrect number: It does not matter whether the number is spelled out or is in digits.
  - 1: Incorrect named entity: This includes people, places, teams, and days of the week.
  - 2: Incorrect word: A word which is not one of the above and is incorrect.
  - 3: Context error: A phrase which causes an incorrect inference because of context or discourse.
  - 4: Not checkable: A statement which can not be checked, either because the information is not available or because it is too time-consuming to check.
  - 5: Other: Any other type of mistake.

  The list should be sorted by the position of the error in the text.
