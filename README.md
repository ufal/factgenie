## 📢  News
- **08/10/2024** - We added  [step-by-step walkthrougs](../../wiki/00-Tutorials) on using factgenie for generating and annotating outputs for a dataset of basketball reports 🏀
- **07/10/2024** - Example datasets have been removed from the repository. Instead, you can find them in the "external resources" section on the [data management page](https://github.com/ufal/factgenie/wiki/02-Data-Management).
- **24/09/2024** - We introduced a brand new factgenie logo!
- **19/09/2024** - On the Analytics page, you can now see detailed statistics about annotations and compute inter-annotator agreement 📈
- **16/09/2024** — You can now collect extra inputs from the annotators for each example using sliders and select boxes. 
- **16/09/2024** - We added an option to generate outputs for the inputs with LLMs directly within factgenie! 🦾

## 👉️ How can factgenie help you?
Outputs from large language models (LLMs) may contain errors: semantic, factual, and lexical. 

With factgenie, you can have the error spans annotated:
- From LLMs through an API.
- From humans through a crowdsourcing service.

Factgenie can provide you:
1. **A user-friendly website** for collecting annotations from human crowdworkers.
2. **API calls** for collecting equivalent annotations from LLM-based evaluators.
3. **A visualization interface** for visualizing the data and inspecting the annotated outputs.

---
*What does factgenie **not help with** is collecting the data (we assume that you already have these), starting the crowdsourcing campaign (for that, you need to use a service such as [Prolific.com](https://prolific.com)) or running the LLM evaluators (for that, you need a local framework such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or a proprietary API).*

## 🏃 Quickstart
Make sure you have Python 3 installed (the project is tested with Python 3.10).

After cloning the repository, the following commands install the package and start the web server:
```
pip install -e .[dev,deploy]
factgenie run --host=127.0.0.1 --port 5000
```
