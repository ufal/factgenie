## 📢  Changelog
- **[1.0.0] - 2024-11-05**: The first official release 🎉

## 👉️ How can factgenie help you?
Outputs from large language models (LLMs) may contain errors: semantic, factual, and lexical. 

With factgenie, you can have the error spans annotated:
- From LLMs through an API.
- From humans through a crowdsourcing service.

Factgenie can provide you:
1. **A user-friendly website** for collecting annotations from human crowdworkers.
2. **API calls** for collecting equivalent annotations from LLM-based evaluators.
3. **A visualization interface** for visualizing the data and inspecting the annotated outputs.

---
*What does factgenie **not help with** is collecting the data (we assume that you already have these), starting the crowdsourcing campaign (for that, you need to use a service such as [Prolific.com](https://prolific.com)) or running the LLM evaluators (for that, you need a local framework such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or a proprietary API).*

## 🏃 Quickstart
Make sure you have Python >=3.9 installed.

If you want to quickly try out factgenie, you can install the package from PyPI:
```bash
pip install factgenie
```

However, the recommended approach for using factgenie is using an editable package:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ufal/factgenie.git
cd factgenie
pip install -e .[dev,deploy]
```
This approach will allow you to manually modify configuration files, write your own data classes and access generated files.

After installing factgenie, use the following command to run the server on your local computer:
```bash
factgenie run --host=127.0.0.1 --port 8890
```
More information on how to set up factgenie is on [Github wiki](../../wiki/Setup).
